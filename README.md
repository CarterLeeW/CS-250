Software Development Lifecycle

The users needs are typically represented in the requirements of the system. In the Scrum-agile framework, the requirements are represented as "user stories." These provide some context for the requirement and are often taken directly from interviews and meetings with the customer and system users.

During this project we were learning about the agile process; this required that we develop the system in increments and test frequently. I would like to continue to implement the agile process of incremental development, where I produce a potentially shippable product at each milestone. This will help me in personal projects where I will focus on having a program that runs at some capacity early on, instead of developing for months only to find that the pieces I put together don't work as a whole.

There are several characteristics that make up a good team member. Good team members are expert communicators, and frequently share progress and issues with the others, so that everyone is on the same page and has an opportunity to help. Good team members also write clean, readable code; since code is read wore than it is written, it is most important that any team member can understand your code and continue where you left off.
